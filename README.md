Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I built this website to introduce myself, what I do as a career, and my interests.  The home page includes an overview as well as links to sites where I have done my work (FreeCodeCamp, Glitch, CodePen).  In the movies page I included a table, on the music page a list, and on the running page an iframe.  I used Bootstrap grids in the coding page.
