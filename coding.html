    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>
      &emsp;Although I began coding for my physics classes, I recently began learning coding for its own sake, as a separate hobby.  I completed <a href="https://courses.edx.org/certificates/537bda1b7952497abee8d21353038970" target="_blank">CS50x: CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</a>, and currently taking the next course, <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript" target="_blank">CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript</a>.  I also spent a year learning to code through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/raphaeluziel" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a>, where I earned their <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/raphaeluziel/full-stack" target="_blank">Full Stack Certification</a>.  On my <a href="https://www.raphaeluziel.com" target="_blank">personal webpage</a> I have included most of my coding accomplishments, including my projects through freecodecamp, my <a href="http://raphael-cs50-final.herokuapp.com/login" target="_blank">final project for CS50x</a> (the course's projects are at <a href="https://github.com/submit50/raphaeluziel" target="_blank">submit50/raphaeluziel</a>), along with a link to my <a href="https://www.raphaeluziel.com/physics/index.html" target="_blank">old physics class website</a>, that started my coding journey.

        <strong>CS50 final Project</strong><br>
        As I stated in the video, this course was the second toughest course I ever took (behind intro physics), and the most fun course I ever took.

        <strong>Exercise Tracker</strong><br>This project was made using Node.js, Express, Mongoose and MongoDB.  Although I had already learned to use Python, SQL and Flask for server-side projects, this one allowed me to code these projects using ther languages (although the similarity was not obvious at first!)

        <strong>Twitch TV</strong><br>
        This project introduced me to the wonderful, but very confusing world of API's and the asynchronous nature of getting information from external API's.  Before this project, computer programs for me were always logical for they followed the code in order!

        <strong>React</strong><br>
        I still don't realy get <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>, but it was a lot of fun to learn, and then to see how easy it was to insert a react component ino an existing webpage.  I hope to learn more about React in the next CS50 course, <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-mobile-app-development-with-react-native" target="_blank">CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native</a>.

        <strong>Choropleth Map</strong><br>
        This project uses <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a>.  What this project taught me was how it feels to have absolutely no idea of where to even begin.  And it showed me how wonderful it feels to finally figure it out (with a lot of help!).
