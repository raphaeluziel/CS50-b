    <p>
      &emsp;Although I began coding for my physics classes, I recently began learning coding for its own sake, as a separate hobby.  I completed <a href="https://courses.edx.org/certificates/537bda1b7952497abee8d21353038970" target="_blank">CS50x: CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</a>, and currently taking the next course, <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript" target="_blank">CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript</a>.  I also spent a year learning to code through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/raphaeluziel" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a>, where I earned their <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/raphaeluziel/full-stack" target="_blank">Full Stack Certification</a>.  On my <a href="https://www.raphaeluziel.com" target="_blank">personal webpage</a> I have included most of my coding accomplishments, including my projects through freecodecamp, my <a href="http://raphael-cs50-final.herokuapp.com/login" target="_blank">final project for CS50x</a> (the course's projects are at <a href="https://github.com/submit50/raphaeluziel" target="_blank">submit50/raphaeluziel</a>), along with a link to my <a href="https://www.raphaeluziel.com/physics/index.html" target="_blank">old physics class website</a>, that started my coding journey.
